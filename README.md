Welcome to Data Analysis with Tesla Stocks! ðŸ’°ðŸ“ˆ

This is a data analysis project that consists of a dashboard of graphs as well as its analysis. 
The dashboard is created using Dash, and the file for it is found in "tesla_dash.py". Its analysis is found in the Jupyter Notebook titled, "TESLA.ipynb".

The goal for this project is to take all of Tesla's stock data from its first recorded date of June 29th, 2010 until June 24th 2025, 
and give a general summary on its trend as well as see how it has been doing in recent years. In doing so, we derive an honest take on whether Tesla is a good or bad investment (as of June 2025).

The tools used in this project are PostgreSQL for data storage and extraction, Dash, as well as many libraries that are found in "requirements.txt".
